Hill Country A & B
Monday, 11:45AM -12:30PM

It is often said, “Without a struggle there is no progress.” Isn’t that the truth? So, let’s get past the fact that adopting HTML 5 may take some effort, accept the pain, and dig in for results! Come hear OmniUpdate’s Shahab Lashkari, Product Manager, talk specifically about using the new features of HTML 5 to improve your web applications—not replace them! Shahab will share how to use some of the new web form input controls of HTML 5, like sliders and date pickers, to build upon your current HTML 4 applications. He’ll also talk about JavaScript interaction with HTML 5 features, such as video, using the Document Object Model (DOM) API, and using the DOM API to build a rich user experience around the tags (e.g., video) themselves. And, of course, no conversation on HTML 5 would be complete without a discussion of the new canvas and semantic elements. Finally, Shahab will give you a look at how some impressive .edu websites are taking advantage of these techniques. Shahab promises that you’ll leave this HTML 5 session with some great new ideas and practical next-steps for success. So, let’s get started.
