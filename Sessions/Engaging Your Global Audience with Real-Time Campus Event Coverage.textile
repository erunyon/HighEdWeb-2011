Engaging Your Global Audience with Real-Time Campus Event Coverage
SOC5 Social Media Track

Texas Ballroom, IV - VII
Monday, 2:30–3:15 PM

Thanks to the likes of Ustream, Facebook, and Twitter, our global audience can now experience our campus events without having to be there in person. This new found geographical freedom means we can dramatically increase the reach of our current events - without breaking the bank. So in an era of belt-tightening and budget cuts, why are we restricting access to our events to only those that can physically attend? Sharing takeaways from more than a hundred successful live streams, this presentation aims to break down the tools of the trade and share stories of success. Going beyond just live streaming video, you’ll learn how to incorporate a variety of social media platforms to directly engage your audience in real-time. The events are already happening. The technology is already here. It’s time to engage our global audience.
