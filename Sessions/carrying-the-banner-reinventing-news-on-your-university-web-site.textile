Carrying the Banner: Reinventing News on Your University Web Site
TNT3 Content Track

Foothills II
Monday, 10:45â€“11:30 AM

A standard of any university website is the news section, but are we keeping pace with how our audiences discover and consume news content? Do we monitor, promote and publish in real-time? How does news tie into our social media strategy? Are we effectively using content types beyond the written word? Are we doing all we can do to make sure our stories get covered by an ever-changing media? Are we making the most of collaborations and integrations that can improve the quality and expand the visibility of our news content? In this session, I will lay out a range of strategies and tactics for changing our news offices into news organisms in order to more effectively communicate our stories to our online audiences.
