* Mobile is for the user (get the content into their hands)
* Master the content first, worry about tech later
* Create legendary datasources
* Never give up

h2. Content Makers and Shapers

* educate on how to produce content that can be portable
* Know thy audience - understand users and what they want
* You are not the audience - not everyone wants what you do
* Ask stupid questions - find out what people are trying to get at and then help them get it
* Don't offer the answer until you identify the question

* Be brief
* Be bright
* Be done

Step away from the tech and find out what content is useful and how to shape it for use on mobile devices
You don't need to do mobile, you need to mobilize your content

h2. Before messing with the content:

* Set Goals
** know your target audience
** describe the Experience before you start to build - use personas
** Understand your limitations to overcome them (such as limited resources)
** have good content that supports your goals
* Be Honest with what you can accomplish
* Research (especially when it comes to mobile stats)
** tablet experience is not "mobile"
** tablet numbers can artificially inflate mobile stats
** prioritize by what people are trying to get
** Inventory available resources

   ** ask them what they're doing and how they're using their mobile devices
** Know thy competition
   ** understand what others have done
