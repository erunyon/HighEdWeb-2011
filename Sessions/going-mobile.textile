h2. Build a New Mobile Site?

"Mobilize, don't minituarize"

"…The mobile context is so different from the desktop one it deserves direct consideration v. just mangling down a full-size site"

h2. Initial Focus

"It is not about making our site work on a mobile device but making sure they can access what they need when they are mobile."
