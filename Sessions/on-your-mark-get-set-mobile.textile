Foothills II
Tuesday, 8:30â€“9:15AM

There is a lot of buzz about mobile technology and "everything going to mobile." The mobile market is growing steadily every day; the College of William & Mary's website saw a 300% increase in mobile traffic over the past year alone. Despite this radical growth, less than 10% of colleges and universities have a mobile website according to a survey conducted by Dave Olsen at WVU. Building on the success of a webinar we co-hosted with mStoner, we'll use this session to help you take those first steps into the mobile world with confidence. We'll give you an inside look at how William & Mary's mobile site was created, how we're measuring results, and how it has evolved since launch in August 2010. We'll also cover: - the types of information you should offer in mobile format - the decision to create a mobile app or a mobile website - the choice of purchasing an off-the-shelf product or going open-source - trends and guidelines for styling and coding - examples of mobile content from other colleges and universities
