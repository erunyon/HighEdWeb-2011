h2. Cornell's Digital Well -- Dirk P Swart

#APS08 #heweb2011

Working with legal to open source their project.

Creates relations between multiple articles; Group them by project boxes; Then share with people.

Content is not stored in the Digital Well; Instead there are pointers.

h3. Three Problems

Everyone is busy with their jobs.  Hard to find people to help.

Blurring the message, viewing message propagation rates

Inaccuracy of Data

Hard to Find

h3. The State of the Art

People who get the news vs. Centralized reporting on the news; There is a large gulf between the two.

Communicate on all forms of media.  As such content has to be repurposed easily.

Location disinterest - Who cares where on my hard drive email is stored.  I just want to get it.  They created an application that doesn't store the information directly.

h3. Repositories

A place to store information where the meta data is tightly bound with the information itself.  Associate meta-data with data itself.  Who's in the photo, who are the people, what are they doing, and can I use this photo.

Tying into existing repositories; If the meta-data exists, use it.  If it doesn't allow them to enter it.

DSpace or Fedora Commons - designed out of library space; The interfaces were too difficult; Optimized for academics.  Broad data repository structures for lay people is challenging

h3. How It Works

Solving the problem - They drew up various stories about how they needed the data.

To solve the problem, Cornell first generated user stories on what users want and expect.  From their they made it happen.

Ease of use Trumps everything.  Not ease to develop.

Designs that are demonstrably better than what already exists are hard to gain traction.  We are creatures of habits.

Steve Yegger - "Amazon sucks at everything except for making information findable."

Form follows function.  Or form follows fashion.  Navigating from one screen to another screen.  Cornell well is a single page application; lots of ajax.

Every single item is ranked individually for that person.  How do you know is good? Reputation is key for discovering data of value.

It is a project for marketing professionals.

h3. Lessons Learned

* KISS
* You can keep all information on one page
* Changing the way people work is HARD

A tool for communicators it provides efficient, reusable content directly from the source.  Dirk gave his boss talking points for the development, keeping on message.

What kind of funding did you get.  A year for development.  Sharing information culture.  Resources 1 developer; then out-sourced; They wrote a specification to a 3rd party.  They provided an extremely detailed specification document.

It does have the repository of last resort.

It is a domain specific repository.  Imagine the developer community.  Everything in the system is visible to everyone.  It is not drawing in content from social media.
