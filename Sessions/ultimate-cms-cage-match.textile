h1. Ultimate CMS Cage Match

h2. Why is Drupal 7 the ultimate open source CMS for higher education (and everyone else)?

* Theming
  - Create a sub-theme based on a master (i.e. "fork" the theme)

* Content Types
  - Collection of fields (this is for a specific Node)
  - Examples: Basic page, Blog post, etc.

* Taxonomy
  - How you org

* Views
  - Ways to query your content

* Calendaring
  - better than any dedicated web app for calendaring; explore this

h2. Why Wordpress

* Texas used version 6 for awhile
* Trouble setting up content editing in Drupal; The forms grew painful.
* They need a Big Blue Button to click and Publish
* One-click upgrades
* Wordpress has a UI focused team
* Upgrade cycle is much tighter and more disciplined.
