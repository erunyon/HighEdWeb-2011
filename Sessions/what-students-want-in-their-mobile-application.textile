What Students Want in Their Mobile Application
APS3 Applications and Standards Track

Hill Country C & D
Monday, 10:45–11:30 AM

Technology staff at The Ohio State University has formed an unprecedented partnership with students to deliver a mobile application that meets students’ needs. Three technology workers from different department with very different roles will discuss their process of surveying students to understand their needs, working with them to test the application, and using them for development work. The most important new feature on the recent OSU Mobile launch was the ability for students to look up grades and schedules in real time. We’ll discuss the usage and popularity of these and other features, and plans for future phases. We’ll share the technologies used, some of the challenges on a large campus, and how involving students can make things run more smoothly than one might expect.
