Making a CSS Framework that Works for You
TPR2 Technical: Propeller Hats Required Track

Hill Country A & B
Monday, 9:30â€“10:15 AM

This session will cover making a CSS Framework to use at your college or university. The presenter will cover how and why the University of Minnesota - College of Education made a framework that now powers around 100 web sites. This framework was built out of necessity during a time of staff reductions, and used to both encourage individual department designs, while also increasing simplicity in producing and maintaining those sites. The first part of the session will go over the background of making a framework that fits your needs, and the process for deciding what to include and what to leave out. The second part of the presentation will cover that individual code we used in our framework. The code we used will of course be made available at the end of the session as well!
