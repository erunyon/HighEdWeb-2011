#4 - Let things break well
  * Beware of silently failing systems
  * Beware of noisily failing systems

There's a fail safe, things don't explode; They don't cascade.

h2. Techniques When Testing

1) Take the time to test
2) Take great note and write great bug reports -- http://8to.me/bug-reports
  b) Steps to reproduce
  c) What you expected to see
  d) What you saw

  * Acrobat Pro for annotated PDFs
  * NotableApp.com -- Good for sharing bug reports online.
  * Bugherd -- bugherd.com
  * FogBugz -- fogcreek.com/fogbugz

3) Pay attention to instructions -- then violate them
  - Beat up the forms
4) Don't try it only once.  Variations are revealing.
5) Watch the other end of the pipe.
  - Test the results of the actions
  - Confirmation pages
  - Notification emails
  - Insist on seeing the admin interface
6) Listen to that nagging little voice -- because, no it won't be OK.
7) Watch for value.

Listen for silent failure.

Automated Testing in Higher Ed, does this make sense.
