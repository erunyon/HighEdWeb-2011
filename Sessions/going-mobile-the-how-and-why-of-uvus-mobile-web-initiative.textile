Going Mobile! The How and Why of Utah Valley University’s mobile web initiativeTNT9 Content Track

Foothills II
Tuesday, 9:45–10:30 AM

ABSTRACT: Change is in the air – literally! Usage of the web traditionally has been on desktop computers, but mobile device usage is growing exponentially. Some studies predict it will pass traditional web traffic by 2015. Higher education is also seeing rapid growth and the new generation of students arriving at institutions are digitally literate, connected, social, and immediate. Utah Valley University has seen this change occurring and moved forward with a mobile web initiative to better serve students. Come see how they did it, why they did it, the tools used, the questions asked, and decisions made to meet the needs of their mobile users. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM OR ISSUE: Usage of the web traditionally has been in the area of desktop computing devices, browsing for information, services, and functionality. However, recently, more and more of the usage of websites and services is being generated by mobile devices, including handheld devices, cell phones, and mobile computing platforms like the iPad. The mobile device web usage (traffic) is now growing at an exponential rate and many predict it will pass traditional web traffic by as early as 2015. One report states that U.S. mobile web usage grew 110% last year alone. Higher education is also seeing this rapid growth of mobile web traffic. In 2009, 31% of students in grades 9-12 in the United States had smart phones with internet access, and at least 85% of all individuals 15 to 18 years of age had cell phones either with or without Internet access (up from 56% in 2004). The new generation of students arriving at our institutions is digitally literate, connected, social, and immediate. This requires educational institutions and others to become more prolific communicators in these new digital worlds.
