Feeding the Beast: Fostering an API Culture
Monday, October 24, 2011
3:30 p.m.

Higher-Ed sites should no longer survive as information silos. To prevent duplication headaches and to ease in data reuse, Notre Dame developers are writing API's into each application we produce. You need the next 40 days of Student Life events in JSON or XML? We got that. Map data for the Golden Dome in XML, KML or JSON? Not a problem. You can even get your departments page content, news and databases in multiple formats. During this track, we'll discuss the who, why and how this is done, and give several examples of how these API's are being used to feed content to a variety of sites and devices at Notre Dame.
